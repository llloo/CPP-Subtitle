be<00:06:43.350><c> a</c><00:06:43.380><c> better</c><00:06:43.590><c> programmer</c><00:06:44.010><c> you</c><00:06:44.910><c> know</c><00:06:45.030><c> that</c>

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 align:start position:0%
be a better programmer you know that
 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.580 align:start position:0%
be a better programmer you know that
what<00:06:45.540><c> does</c><00:06:45.630><c> that</c><00:06:45.660><c> mean</c><00:06:45.930><c> like</c><00:06:46.200><c> that's</c><00:06:46.380><c> so</c>

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 align:start position:0%
what does that mean like that's so

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
arbitrary that's so you can't just say
 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
arbitrary that's so you can't just say
okay<00:06:48.810><c> well</c><00:06:49.140><c> yeah</c><00:06:49.350><c> I</c><00:06:49.380><c> guess</c><00:06:49.470><c> I</c><00:06:49.800><c> should</c><00:06:49.950><c> pay</c><00:06:50.070><c> more</c>

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 align:start position:0%
okay well yeah I guess I should pay more

attention to my code when I'm

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
programming that's not a solution right
 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.710 align:start position:0%
programming that's not a solution right
that's<00:06:53.610><c> just</c><00:06:53.820><c> I'm</c><00:06:54.060><c> just</c><00:06:54.270><c> saying</c><00:06:54.450><c> that</c><00:06:54.600><c> that's</c>

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's just I'm just saying that that's
 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.390 align:start position:0%
that's just I'm just saying that that's
something<00:06:55.260><c> that</c><00:06:55.440><c> would</c><00:06:55.800><c> be</c><00:06:55.860><c> a</c><00:06:56.010><c> potential</c>

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
something that would be a potential
 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
something that would be a potential

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
problem is yes to be a better programmer
 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.490 align:start position:0%
problem is yes to be a better programmer
and<00:07:00.000><c> then</c><00:07:00.390><c> you</c><00:07:00.480><c> would</c><00:07:00.630><c> need</c><00:07:00.840><c> to</c><00:07:00.900><c> worry</c><00:07:01.350><c> about</c>

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
and then you would need to worry about
 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
and then you would need to worry about

be such a fragile and pedantic kind of

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:52.769 align:start position:0%
so yes smart pointers are really good
 

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:55.730 align:start position:0%
so yes smart pointers are really good
you<00:08:53.069><c> should</c><00:08:53.100><c> 100%</c><00:08:53.490><c> use</c><00:08:54.269><c> smart</c><00:08:54.750><c> pointers</c><00:08:55.139><c> never</c>

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
you should 100% use smart pointers never
 

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.769 align:start position:0%
you should 100% use smart pointers never
